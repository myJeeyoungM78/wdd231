Purpose:

* I'm planning a hobby-sharing and a small business website. 
The main page is designed to be an attractive advertising page with useful information about your hobby.
It also has a child page where you can sell products related to that hobby. 

* I recently bought a new machine. I'm thinking of starting a small internet business with it.
